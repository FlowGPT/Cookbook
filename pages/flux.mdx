### Am I able to cash out my Flux into real money?
Yes. Flux earned from Bounties and tippings are eligible for cash out.

There is a 20% cash out fee and additional fees based on your country of residence and chosen payment method.


### How do I request a Flux cash out?
Please note, a FlowGPT staff member will never reach out to you in order to initiate a cash out. Only you can begin the process yourself following the instructions below.

Once you have earned at least 35,000 Flux ($350 USD) from Bounties & Tippings, you can contact jay@flowgpt.com with the subject line "Flux Cash Out - userID", replacing "userID" with your FlowGPT userID (can be found in your profile page's URL). In the body of your email, write the number of Flux that you wish to cash out & your FlowGPT profile link.

If this is your first cash out, we will send you an online form to verify your identity on Persona. You will need a valid government ID and a device with a camera to complete this verification.

After that, we will need to verify your payment information through email.

Once we have verified your identity and payment information on your FlowGPT account, we will withdraw the requested amount of Flux from your wallet and execute the payment. If you no longer have a payable balance of Flux equivalent to the amount you requested, we will cancel the payment and ask you for a new desired amount to withdraw.
