## 7. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution

These Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction where FlowGPT is located, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Any disputes arising from or relating to these Terms or the Services shall be resolved through good faith negotiations between the parties. If such negotiations fail to resolve the dispute, the parties agree to submit the dispute to binding arbitration under the rules of the applicable arbitration organization, with the prevailing party entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.

## 8. Miscellaneous

If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. The failure of FlowGPT to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms does not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by FlowGPT without restriction. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and FlowGPT concerning the Services and supersede and replace any prior agreements between you and FlowGPT with respect to the Services.
