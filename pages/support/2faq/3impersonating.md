# How do I stop my prompt from speaking for me?

See: [Writing an Effective Welcome Message](/howto/web#writing-an-effective-welcome-message)

Essentially, writing your `Welcome Message` to include more of a focus on the *user* (whether through detailing their actions, emotions, or backstory) will prompt the AI model to *continue* talking about the user.

To prevent or reduce this issue, rewrite your `Welcome Message` to encompass only your character's actions or the setting of the game. Information about the user should be placed in the `Intro` section (under the `Publish` tab) instead.

Alternatively, you can also try instructing the model to avoid detailing the user's actions through the `System Prompt`, although this *can* be less effective.
