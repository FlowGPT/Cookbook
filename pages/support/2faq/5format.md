# Which format is the best to use for my prompt?

While pseudo-code can work for most AI models, often times the most *effective* format is simply prose - normal paragraphs and sentences, like how you'd explain a character to a real person. However, it may be difficult to fit paragraphs' worth of information into a small context. In *those* cases, it *is* recommended to use pseudo-code, if cutting down on words is not possible.
