# Which AI model is the best?

Technically, there *is* no model that is 'the best'. While some are certainly more 'intelligent' and have more 'memory' than others, it's important to also consider the model's use-case.

For example, GPT-4 Turbo may be the most advanced model we offer here at FlowGPT, but it's also heavily censored and costs Flux to use. If you prefer uncensored chats or simply don't have the Flux to spend, you may prefer to use smaller models, such as Pygmalion or Mixtral.

We recommend experimenting with models to see what works best for you. Alternatively, you can join the FlowGPT Discord server and ask our community for tips based on your use-case.
