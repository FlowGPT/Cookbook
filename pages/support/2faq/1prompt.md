# What is a prompt?

See: [What is prompt engineering?](/engineering/1basics/1intro)

In layman's terms, a prompt (in our context) is a set of instructions that tells an AI model what to do or how to act. This can range from a simple order to "Generate an image of a raincloud" to an extensive list of traits, backstories, and worldbuilding in order for the AI to roleplay as a popular videogame character.
