# How can I advertise my prompts?

In the FlowGPT Discord server, we have various channels for users to advertise their prompts. Feel free to join and post there!

Alternatively, based on our research into our most popular prompts, you can take these steps to boost your prompt's usage:
* Choose "Character Category" and apply the relevant tags to help the system push your prompts to your target audience
* Include the key characteristics of your prompt in the title - for instance, "James - Dominant King"
* Include your character's appearance (height, hair color, etc) in the Description section
* Make sure to have world-building elements (setting, character descriptions, etc) in the Welcome Message. This engages users more quickly, and prompts the AI to carry the conversation. Avoid only having a simple greeting such as "Hello" (See: [Writing an Effective Welcome Message](/howto/web#writing-an-effective-welcome-message))
* When writing a prompt, make sure to include example conversations to help the LLM better understand your character's personality and tone (See: [Advanced Character Settings: Example Conversations](/howto/web#example-conversations))
