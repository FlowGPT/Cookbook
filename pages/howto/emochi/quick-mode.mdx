## Character Definition

This is where you can include information about your character to have their details generated!
In the Character Definition, you can provide a brief description of your character, such as their
appearance, personality, or the overall vibe they convey. The more detailed your description, the
more accurate the generated content will be.

> If you've uploaded a reference image but want to add additional details not
> shown in the picture, you can include those in the Character Definition as
> well.

## Image

`Reference Images` vs `Upload`:

- `Reference Images`: The system will use the image you upload as a reference to generate a similar
  character design.
- `Upload`: The image you upload will be used directly as the final result.

  _Note: Any images uploaded will have to be cropped to fit the 1:1 ratio!_

## Style

Pick your favorite art style for the character's image! You can choose 1 to 4 styles, and Emochi will
generate four images based on your selection. (For example, if you choose two styles, you'll get two
images in each style.)

Once all the above details are complete, simply click Continue to generate your character!

## Reference Image choose

Choose one of the four generated characters.
If you're not satisfied, you can click Back or the top-right again to return (and modify the content
from the first step if you wish), then click Continue again. Emochi will generate four new characters
for you again.

When you have selected your character, click Next to proceed to the next step!

## Character Details

Add the finishing touches to your character's details on this page to make them truly unique.

Your selected character might not have all the details you envisionedâ€”that's okay!

In Quick Mode, Emochi has created a character details page based on your previous inputs.
Now you can bring your character to life by refining their name, personality, voice, and
conversation style. You can also add community details, like whether they're public and which
tags describe them best.

Once you're all set, click Next and then Publish your character!
