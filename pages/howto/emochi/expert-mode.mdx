# Expert mode

The initial page helps you to generate images for your character.

## Reference or Upload

`Reference Images` vs `Upload character image`:

- `Reference Images`: The system will use the image you upload as a reference to generate
  similar images. (Note: Any images uploaded will need to be cropped to fit a 1:1 ratio!)
- `Upload character image`: This system will use your uploaded image directly, skipping the
  image generation step and moving to the next stage!

## Character Definition

In Character Definition, select your character's gender, then enter details like appearance,
build, and pose to generate their portrait. The more detailed your description, the more accurate
the generated content will be.

> If you've uploaded a reference image but want to add additional details not
> shown in the picture, you can include those in the Character Definition as
> well.

## Style

Pick your favorite art style for the character's image! You can choose 1 ~ 4 styles, and Emochi will
generate four images based on your selection. (For example, if you choose two styles, you'll get two
images in each style.)

Once all the above details are complete, simply click `Generate` to generate your character!

## Image choose

Choose one of the four generated images.
If you're not satisfied, you can click `Re-Generate`. Or click `the top-left` and `the top-right`
to return and modify the content from the first step, then click `Generate` again. Emochi will generate
four new images for you again.

When you have selected your character, click `Select` to proceed to the next step!

## Create Character Details

On this page, you'll bring your character to life, shaping them from 0 to 1.
In Expert Mode, your character starts with just an image. It's up to you to give them life! Choose their
name, personality, and voice, and create their intro, welcome message, and scenario. Like a creative scholar,
you'll shape your character from scratch, making them truly your own.

Here's an example of how to write your character's details:

<img
  src="/emochi/expertMode/17.jpg"
  style={{ width: "49%", display: "inline-block" }}
/>
<img
  src="/emochi/expertMode/18.jpg"
  style={{ width: "49%", display: "inline-block" }}
/>

<img
  src="/emochi/expertMode/19.jpg"
  style={{ width: "49%", display: "inline-block" }}
/>
<img
  src="/emochi/expertMode/20.jpg"
  style={{ width: "49%", display: "inline-block" }}
/>

Once you're all set, click Next and then Publish your character!
