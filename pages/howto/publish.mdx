- **Example Conversations:** serves to show a demo to users on how this bot can be used. It will be displayed as the preview chats when users hover over a bot card. It will also be used as the first community chat. If you don't know how to create an example conversation, you can auto-generate it using our AI.
- **Category:** serves to put your prompt in a special category and subcategory. We have many categories and subcategories, and you can choose only one.
- **Hashtags:** serves to add tags related to your prompt that can help in SEO optimization of your prompt. With good hashtags, you can make your prompt more optimized.
- **Permissions:** We have 5 different permissions. This includes permissions for NSFW content, allowing the community to find your prompt, to see the prompt, create a reference based on your prompt, and allow users to edit AI responses. Each option can be turned on or off, depending on what you want.
