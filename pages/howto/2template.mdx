### Tips for creating templates


- **Use keywords.** When creating a template, it is helpful to use keywords that will help the AI model understand what you are looking for. For example, if you are creating a template for generating a poem, you could use keywords such as "poetry," "verse," and "rhyme" in `{name:value}` option.
- **Use examples.** If you can, it is helpful to provide examples of the type of content that you are looking for. For example, if you are creating a template for generating a blog post, you could provide examples of blog posts that you like. You can say that ChatGPT should bold important things using `**`, make title or subtitle using `#` and `#`, etc.
- **Use tags.** Tags are a great way to categorize your templates and make them easier to find. When creating a template, you can add tags to the template. Tags can be anything that you want, such as the topic of the template, the type of content that you are looking for, or the author of the template.

Here are some examples of templates created on FlowGPT:

- **Blog post:** A blog post is a type of article that is published on a blog. To create a blog post template, you would need to include the following information:
  - The title of the blog post `{title:FlowGPT}`
  - The introduction of the blog post `{intro:Blog post about FlowGPT Hackathon}`
  - The body of the blog post
  - The conclusion of the blog post
  - The tags for the blog post
- **Poem:** A poem is a piece of writing that uses rhythm and rhyme to create a certain effect. To create a poem template, you would need to include the following information:
  - The title of the poem
  - The type of poem (e.g., sonnet, haiku, free verse)
  - The rhyme scheme
  - The meter
- **Script:** A script is a written document that tells the actors what to say and do in a play, movie, or TV show. To create a script template, you would need to include the following information:
  - The title of the script
  - The characters in the script
  - The setting of the script
  - The plot of the script
- **Song:** A song is a piece of music that has lyrics. To create a song template, you would need to include the following information:
  - The title of the song
  - The genre of the song (e.g., pop, rock, country)
  - The lyrics of the song
  - The melody of the song
- **Email:** An email is a message that is sent electronically from one person to another. To create an email template, you would need to include the following information:
  - The sender's name `{sender:zigamak9@gmail.com}`
  - The recipient's name `{recipient:jay@flowgpt.com}`
  - The subject of the email `{subject:Bugs}`
  - The body of the email `{body:bug information}`
  - The attachments to the email `{attachments:links, pictures, etc.}`

These are just a few examples of the types of templates that you can create on FlowGPT. With a little creativity, you can create templates for any type of content that you can imagine.
