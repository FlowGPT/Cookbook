# Features Tab

After you have finished with the Create Tab, it's time to delve into Features. Features are optional, so it's not mandatory to include them. FlowGPT offers 4 fantastic features: Image Generation, Voice Generation, Code Interpreter, and Template. Let's explain each one. ![img](https://i.imgur.com/eT73tUI.png)

1. **Image Generation:** As the name suggests, this feature enables your prompt (or character) to generate images. This allows for personalization of the user experience and is very interesting to use. Currently, we offer 10 Image Generation models that you can use for free, and soon there will be more. ![img](https://i.imgur.com/JcZg62V.png)
2. **Voice Generation:** This feature is a classic Text-to-Speech. When enabled, any text within double quotes will generate a voice that users can listen to. This is very useful in Character prompts. Currently, we offer 15 Voice models of different genders, and more will be available soon. ![img](https://i.imgur.com/w656fJK.png)
3. **Code Interpreter:** If you are creating a programming prompt, this feature is for you. This feature provides a Code Interpreter which ensures that every generated code is actually correct and works as it should. This feature can only be used with GPT-4 Turbo. ![img](https://i.imgur.com/FkbLdKQ.png)
4. **Template:** If you want to create variables that users can use, this feature is for you. The user will see placeholder fields at the beginning of the conversation that they must fill. ![img](https://i.imgur.com/WCw9hWH.png)
