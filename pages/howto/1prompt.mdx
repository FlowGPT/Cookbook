## Step 1 - Create

1. Model Settings
   The first step in creating a prompt is to choose the model that will be the default model for your bot. Users can change the model themselves, but the model you choose here will be used as the default. FlowGPT offers 10+ different models, from creative to accurate ones. Some models require Flux for use. Besides models, we recommend experimenting with the temperature parameter. This parameter controls how creative the model is in generating responses. A higher number means more creativity, but don't set it too high as it can lead to hallucinations.

2. Customization
   The second step is customizing your prompt. Here we include Image cover, chat background customization, name, and description.

   - **Image Cover:** This is the image of your prompt that users will see. You can put our FlowGPT preset photos or upload your own.
     - **Preset Covers:** If you choose FlowGPT preset photos, you can select any image from the offered categories. ![img](https://i.imgur.com/ZSzMpxE.png)
     - **Custom Covers:** If you want to put your own image cover, click on Upload Cover, choose a picture, then edit it and that's it. ![img](https://i.imgur.com/c5qX1ry.png)
   - **Chat Background Customization:** This is the background image of your chat. With this, you can personalize the User Experience where you can put a different background for each prompt. ![img](https://i.imgur.com/Rkyh0oB.jpg)
   - **Name & Description:** These are the name and description of your prompt. For the name, it's enough to state what this prompt is, and in the description, you can describe it in more detail. Besides that, you can write other details in the description such as change logs, bug fixes, guidelines, and similar.
3. Prompt
   The next step is writing the prompt. Prompts guide AI responses with instructions and constraints. What do you want the model to do? What is some relevant background information? What are the constraints or limitations that the model should adhere to, and similar. More detailed prompts will make your bot better because it will follow your rules more closely.
   Besides the prompt, there are Context, Welcome Message, and Suggested Questions.

   - **Context:** Context is the external brain to provide extra knowledge from files. You can upload files or import datasets to add to the context. It can be a book, research paper, or something else.
   - **Welcome Message:** Welcome message is the initial message of your bot. It serves to welcome the user into the conversation. You can write a custom Welcome Message or let AI create its own welcome message.
   - **Suggested Questions:** Sometimes users don't know what to write to start a conversation, and Suggested Questions help by giving users some examples. You can write these examples yourself or use Auto Fill for AI to create them.
4. Auto Create
   Sometimes you have the perfect idea for a bot but don't know how to make it, or you want to quickly create a bot. The Auto Create function can help by doing everything for you including creating the name, description, image cover, prompt, welcome message, and suggested questions. All that is needed for this to work is to write your idea, and that's it. Of course, if you put more details, Auto Create will do a better job, but it works perfectly even with short ideas.
