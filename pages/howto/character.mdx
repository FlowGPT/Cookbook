1. Model Settings
   The first step in creating a character prompt is to choose the model that will be the default model for your bot. Users can change the model themselves, but the model you choose here will be used as the default. FlowGPT offers 10+ different models, from creative to nsfw ones for character creation. Some models require Flux for use. Besides models, we recommend experimenting with the temperature parameter. This parameter controls how creative the model is in generating responses. A higher number means more creativity, but don't set it too high as it can lead to hallucinations.

2. Customization
   The second step is customizing your prompt. Here we include Character Avatar, chat background customization, name, and description.

   - **Character Avatar:** This is the avatar of your character that users will see. You can put our FlowGPT preset avatars or upload your own.
     - **Preset Avatars:** If you choose FlowGPT preset avatars, you can select any avatar from the offered categories. ![img](https://i.imgur.com/idSIrjN.png)
     - **Custom Avatars:** If you want to put your own avatar, click on Upload Cover, choose an avatar, then edit it and that's it. ![img](https://i.imgur.com/K8jzXVb.png)
   - **Chat Background Customization:** This is the background image of your chat. With this, you can personalize the User Experience where you can put a different background for each character prompt. ![img](https://i.imgur.com/Agbb88B.jpg)
   - **Name & Description:** These are the name and description of your character prompt. For the name, it's enough to state the name of your character, and in the description, you can describe it in more detail. Besides that, you can write other details in the description such as change logs, bug fixes, guidelines, and similar.
   3. Prompt
   The next step is writing the character prompt. Prompts guide AI responses with instructions and constraints. More detailed prompts will make your character better because it will follow your rules more closely. Follow these steps:
   - **Personality:** Here you will explain character's personality to help the model to understand the character and how to act like it. More details will make personality better. ![img](https://i.imgur.com/U7adyw9.png)
   - **Greeting:** This is first message from your character which user will see. Try to write first message in same style as that character so that model can follow it. ![img](https://i.imgur.com/1ffDZ46.png)
   - **Advanced Character Details:** Here you can find 3 additional fields such as Scenario, Examples and System Message. Filling all of this can help in improving user experience but it is not mandatory. ![img](https://i.imgur.com/NasRZQ9.png)
